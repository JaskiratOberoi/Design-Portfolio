    description: "A comprehensive prototype was developed to demonstrate the functionality of the new bulk selector planned for integration into the Detail Page of select products.  A key feature of this prototype was an optimizer algorithm designed to analyze user selections and suggest alternative combinations that maintain the desired order quantity while potentially lowering the overall cost due to varying price points across different pack sizes. User research sessions utilizing this prototype were successfully conducted in the UK and Germany markets.  However, due to resource constraints on the development team, full integration of the new component into the 'Details Page Experience' is anticipated in the latter half of 2023.",
