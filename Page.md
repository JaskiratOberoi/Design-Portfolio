## Live Demo: Available (scroll down)

A comprehensive prototype was developed to demonstrate the functionality of the new bulk selector planned for integration into the Detail Page of select products. A key feature of this prototype was an optimizer algorithm designed to analyze user selections and suggest alternative combinations that maintain the desired order quantity while potentially lowering the overall cost due to varying price points across different pack sizes.

User research sessions utilizing this prototype were successfully conducted in the UK and Germany markets. However, due to resource constraints on the development team, full integration of the new component into the 'Details Page Experience' has been put on the back-burner for the time being.

#### Tech Used:

- JavaScript
- Pug Framework
- jQuery
- Scss CSS pre-processor
- Atomic Design for components structure (atoms, molecules, organisms)
- i18n for software internationalization

### User Testing

Tests were performed with customer groups of 15 individuals each, turn by turn from the UK and Germany.

### User Journey

- They can scroll down to see Peet’s coffee OR Start typing ‘coffee’ in the search bar and click search
- In the search results page, the customer will scroll to Peet’s coffee and select the same
- Customer reaches the detail page of the product, here they can make the selection in the comprehensive new bulk picker OR just add a random bulk quantity in the ‘Quantity box’ present in the sidebar
- Post entering the value and pressing enter, the ‘Optimizer Algorithm’ executes and calculates the best possible combination of packs that satisfies the quantity value and is the most cost-effective selection
- Customer can now add the selection to cart and proceed to checkout
- During checkout they need to select a custom delivery date for their convenience and finalize their order
